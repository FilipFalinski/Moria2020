# Guide to contributing to this project using GitHub

1. Log into your own personal GitHub Account (Create one if necessasry)
2. Navigate to this (Robert-Sheehy/Moria2020) repository. (Link will be made available)
3. Fork the repository by clicking the fork button.
        This creates an up to date copy of the repository on your personal account (YourName/Moria2020) , which you may adjust
        You will notice that it will mention that it was forked from (Robert-Sheehy/Moria2020) and it will also state whether the 
        branch is (even i.e. up to date)  behind (there are edits from other people on main repo, not on your repo) or ahead (where 
        you have changes made that have not been sent to the main repo)
        # Note if your repo is not even with the main repo they will need to be synced (see later....)
4. To work on your repository, you will need to clone onto your machine, this is usually called the local repo, 
      to do this you need the URL of your personal copy of the repo (YourName/Moria2020).
      Clicking the Clone or download gives the option of copying the URL to the clipboard.
      On the desktop, navigate to where you would like to store the local copy
      Right-Click > Git GUI Here
      
     For the first time on a given machine we will need to select the Clone Existing Option. Copy the URL into the Source Destination, for the target destination browse to where you would like to place the Repo, select the appropriate directory, Desktop for example, and then add the name for the folder containg the repo   e.g.  ....Desktop/Foldername
      
      You now have a local copy of the repo which you can work on. Minimise Git GUI.

5.  You are now free to edit the local version of the project on yor computer. This will mean that you may
        . Edit and existing file
        . Create a new file
        . Delete an existing file
        
    Once you have completed your edits it is now necessay to upload your edits back to the cloud.
    
 6. Uploading/updating the changes you made to the Group Repository involves 2 steps by you and 1 by the administrator of the Group Repo.
 
        .  First you must upload your changes to your local repository, to do this
                . save all work and close all editors
                . maximise Git GUI, rescan, stage all changes you wish to send on
                . Enter a Commit message, Commit and  PUSH
           You should now see the changes on your personal GitHub account
           
         .  Secondly, you must now create a pull request from your personal GitHub account, to the main Group repository. Usually your 
         commit message is already there, you may change it or add to it at this stage. Do not close the Pull request unless you have
         decided that you do not want to submit. Your role is done at this stage
         
         . Finally, the pull request appear on the Admin account, and is usually accepted if merging is possible.  We will discuss                  conflicts at a later stage.
